# Focal Sweep(FS)-Dataset
We collect the dataset in 234 different scenes, including three categories: portrait scenes, object scenes and portrait-object mixed scenes. The depth range of our dataset is between 300mm and 1200mm. The example focal sweep images of three categories and their corresponding all-in-focus images are shown below. In order to improve the robustness of the dataset, we set 9 different ETL current change range for focal sweep imaging in each scene. Thus, our dataset contains a total of 2106 sets of different image pairs. Our dataset is the first focal sweep image dataset, and this data is enough to train a network for focal sweep imaging.
